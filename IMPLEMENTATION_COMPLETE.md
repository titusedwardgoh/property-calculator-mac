# Supabase Session & User Management - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully refactored the application to support both anonymous and authenticated users with proper session management. The system now tracks users via permanent `device_id` while creating new sessions for each form attempt.

## What Was Implemented

### Database Schema
- Created `users` table for future authentication
- Added `device_id` column to `properties` table
- Added foreign key constraint linking `user_id` to `users` table
- SQL script saved: `supabase-schema-update.sql`

### Session Management
- **Device ID**: Generated once, stored in localStorage forever
- **Session ID**: Generated fresh on every page load
- No auto-restore of form data on page refresh (clean slate each time)

### Behavior

| Scenario | device_id | session_id | Result |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| First visit | Generated, stored | Generated fresh | New property record created |
| Page refresh | Same | NEW generated | Previous saved, form empty |
| Close browser, reopen | Same | NEW generated | Previous saved, form empty |
| Start Over clicked | Same | NEW generated | Previous saved, form empty |

### Files Modified
1. `supabase-schema-update.sql` (created)
2. `src/lib/sessionManager.js`
3. `src/hooks/useSupabaseSync.js`
4. `src/app/api/supabase/route.js`
5. `src/stores/formStore.js`

## How It Works

### For Anonymous Users (Current)
1. First visit generates a `device_id` stored in localStorage
2. Each page load generates a new `session_id`
3. Form data auto-saves to Supabase as user types (500ms debounce)
4. Multiple sessions per device are tracked via same `device_id`

### For Authenticated Users (Future Ready)
- When user signs up: set `user_id` in localStorage
- When saving: include `user_id` in database record
- Can query all properties for a specific user

## Future Enhancements

1. Add Supabase Auth integration
2. "My Properties" dashboard
3. Resume session functionality
4. Analytics and reporting

## Testing Verification

✅ Page refresh creates new session, previous data saved
✅ Start Over button creates new session
✅ Same device tracked across sessions
✅ Form progress saved in real-time
✅ No console errors
